# Initial deliverables
1. (Sanity check) Run gc algorithms on some test models
    - Make sure you can build sign post and integer DS
    - Get it to visualize
2. Duplicate the interface to the integer ds
    - Make own version to make edits to it
    - Figure where it implements insertion of verts
    - Look at signpost functions to get the external trace out so you know how many external vers an edge crosses so that you can update those numbers for the int DS
    - After insertion and get DS to same assumptions as integer
    - Do cleanup of signpost data after insertion
        - You don't need signpost data after insertion, only while inserting?

# Things to do
- Setup geom central repo
- Get cracking on the original signpost idea
- Then convert to using hybrid model
